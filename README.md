# Magik for Visual Studio Code

The [VS Code Magik extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ge-smallworld.magik-vscode) provides rich support for the Magik programming language used in the GE Vernova Smallworld Geo Network Management (GNM) platform.

## Requirements

* Smallworld version 4 or 5
* Visual Studio Code 1.75 or newer (or editors compatible with VS Code 1.75+ APIs)

## Quick Start

Welcome to the world of Magik programming for Smallworld GNM!

Whether you are new to Magik or a long time veteran, you will find features of this extension that can improve your development experience.

Here is the quickest way to get started Programming Magik.

1. Install the version of [Smallworld GNM (formerly Smallworld)](https://www.ge.com/digital/applications/smallworld-gis-geospatial-asset-management) that corresponds to your needs (including Smallworld GNM components and custom code).
2. Install the [VS Code Magik extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ge-smallworld.magik-vscode).
3. Start a Smallworld session by typing the sequence `<F2>` then `Z` and follow the instructions to start the session (to start a _product_ session) or
start your custom session from the command line of a terminal using the _runalias.exe_ application (typically found in _core\bin\x86_ of your Smallworld installation).  See the topic [Launcher program](https://smallworld-gnm.gevernova.com/documentation/sw53/en/swDocs5.htm#../Subsystems/Core/Content/Sessions/LauncherProgram.htm?TocPath=Technology%2520platform%257CCore%257CMagik%2520sessions%257C_____5) on the Smallworld GNM documentation website for more details.  
4. Once the session has started, while a Magik code file editor has the focus, type `<CTRL>+<ALT>+M` to initialize the interface with the running Magik session.

## What's Next

Once you are able to start a Magik session and associate the session with your editor, you are ready to start programming Magik.  If you are new to programming Magik in Smallworld GNM, go over to the [Application Development section](https://smallworld.gedigitalenergy.com/documentation/sw53/en/swDocs5.htm#../Subsystems/AppDev/Content/A_Navigation/Pages/HomeAppDev5.htm?TocPath=Technology%2520platform%257CApplication%2520Development%2520(Magik)%257C_____1) on the Smallworld GNM documentation web sight.

If you are already familiar with Magik and Smallworld, read through the feature highlights below for more information on using the VS Code extension to help you write Magik code.

The hotkey `<CTRL>+<SHFT>+P` is used to open the command palette in Visual Studio Code.  You can first open the command palette, then type _magik_ to discover the features of the VS Code Magic extension.

## Feature highlights

* See [Compiling code and running tests](./docs/compiling.md) to understand how to compile code in your session.
* See [Using the class browser](./docs/navigation.md) to understand how to use the class browser tool and navigate in VS Code.
* See [Formatting and Editing](./docs/formatting.md) for information on formatting Magik code and using editing templates.
